# Overview

An app which uses GIPHY's API to return specific gifs.My theme for this app was TV shows. You'd click on a tv show button, it'd make an API request to Giphy, and then display 10 gif's relating to that tv show. This app also allows the user to enter a tv show of their choice, which would create a button, and then function the exact same as the other buttons.
